The aim of the game is to find your opponent an destory them using bullets.
The solid light in the middle of the screen is you- protect yourself at all cost!
The other solid light's are walls- navigate the map by moving around these blockades.
The periodicly flashing light you may find is your enemy (the other player)- fire at will!
Shooting will fire in the direction you last moved in (or attempted to move in)- bullets will stop at walls.
You have 3 HP (hit points)- if you get hit by an enemy bullet you lose a HP.
You will begin flashing to alert your loss of HP- lose all your HP and game over.
Your enemy also has 3 HP - take them down by shooting bullets to hit your opponent.
The blue LED will turn on to indicate a successful strike. Drop their HP to 0 and you win!
